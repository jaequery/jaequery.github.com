		<p>This one was a bit of a hair puller but finally found out why I could not reset a cookie.<br/>
All the stuffs online tells you to use:</p>

<p>setcookie(&#8216;yourcookie&#8217;, &#8220;, time() - 86400);</p>

<p>Well apparently this fails for most web apps.</p>

<p>What will work however is this:</p>

<p>setcookie(&#8216;yourcookie&#8217;, &#8220;, time() - 86400, &#8216;/&#8217;);</p>

<p>The reason being is that I am setting my cookie initially from /auth/login. So this means my cookie will only live inside /auth path. But by setting &#8216;/&#8217; to reset it, it tells it to reset for all the sub folders in the site.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am running an online service that gets about 500k hits/day. It&#8217;s a new service I started up beginning of december last year but growing at an incredible rate so I never had time to properly lay out a scalable infrastructure. Up until now, I was running it on a single dedicated server but noticed it was starting to take a toll on the server and didn&#8217;t want to affect the other sites on the server (load avg 1.5+) so I decided to move it to Rackspace cloud.</p>

<p>So I set up the instances:<br/>
- 1 haproxy load balancer (256 mb)<br/>
- 1 memcache (256 mb)<br/>
- 3 apache (1 gig)<br/>
- 1 nginx (1 gig)<br/>
- 1 mysql master (1 gig)<br/>
- 1 mysql slave (1 gig)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d have imagine this would be enough to handle this much traffic but my app servers kept swapping time to time. There was no way I was going to spin up even more apache servers as I know this will cost me more than double what I used to pay for the dedicated server which was holding up just fine.</p>

<p>First thing I did was move over from apache to nginx using php5-fpm. It works fine as a single dedicated instance but when it is routed off of haproxy, it was giving me some strange errors. Since I didn&#8217;t have much time to tinker with it, I decided to try something I always heard about but never tried before, Apache MPM-WORKER.</p>

<p>So after googling around, I found a really nifty tutorial (can&#8217;t remember where I got this from) which only took me like 2 minutes to go from apache mpm-prefork to mpm-worker. And as soon as I changed to it, I saw my load drop dramatically and I even went from 3 apache&#8217;s to just 1 apache and still holding up well. </p>

<p>So I highly recommend those of you looking to go to nginx or trying to scale their apache, take a jab at trying out the apache mpm-worker w/ php5 fcgi. It works flawlessly. I&#8217;d say it works just as well as nginx + php5 fpm.</p>

<hr />

<p>When you install lamp on Ubuntu 10.04 , apache comes by default as mpm-prefork.<br/>
But you will want to instead use mpm-worker, as it will use less memory and be more efficient. </p>

<p>To use the “worker” MPM with PHP, do the following:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1. </strong>Stop the apache2 daemon</p>

<p><code>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 2.  </strong>Uninstall <em>apache2-mpm-prefork</em></p>

<p><code>sudo aptitude remove apache2-mpm-prefork</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong>  Install <em>apache2-mpm-worker</em> and <em>apache2-threaded-dev</em></p>

<p><code>sudo aptitude install apache2-mpm-worker apache2-threaded-dev</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enable <em>CGI</em> and <em>mod_actions</em> (may already be enabled)</p>

<p><code>sudo a2enmod cgid``2``sudo a2enmod actions</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong>  Create a file in <em>/etc/apache2/conf.d</em> with the following content (I called mine php5-cgi.conf):</p>

<p><code>&lt;IfModule mod_actions.c&gt;``2``        ``Action application/x-httpd-php /cgi-bin/php5``3``&lt;/IfModule&gt;</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong>  Start the apache2 daemon</p>

<p><code>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start</code></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Nginx by default does not include the setup necessary for PHP.  For that, we will need to configure the php5-fpm package.  We will first discuss that package, and then discuss configuring nginx to work with php5-fpm.  Note that the actions done in this HOW-TO will most likely need superuser rights, either via the use of sudo or by the use of the superuser account.</p>

<h2>php5-fpm</h2>

<ol>
<li>We need to install php5-fpm and its dependencies.  The version from the Ubuntu repositories will work well:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>sudo apt-get install php5-fpm
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>We will begin by editing the php.ini file.  Open the php.ini file in the current directory with your favorite editor (I prefer using nano, but you’re free to use vim, emacs, or any other editor you like, as long as its run as superuser with sudo):</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>We will be configuring the php5-fpm process to use a socket.  This will allow for nginx to more easily communicate with the php5-fpm process to serve the PHP content to the Internet.  Inside the <a href="http://www.conf">www.conf</a> file, look for the line starting with:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>listen =
</code></pre>

<p>and replace that line so it instead says:</p>

<pre><code>listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the php5-fpm process to only listen for incoming PHP processing requests in the socket file located in the /var/run/ directory.</p>

<ol>
<li>Restart the php5-fpm service:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>sudo service php5-fpm restart
</code></pre>

<p>If all was configured correctly, then the php5-fpm service should have restarted without any errors.  On to configuring your nginx site for working with PHP.</p>

<h2>nginx Site Configuration</h2>

<p>NOTE!  There are different steps you will need to take in order to get PHP on nginx working if you want to use SSL!  <em>Those steps are not covered in this HOW-TO, but may be covered in a future HOW-TO, so keep an eye on this blog!</em></p>

<p>We will now begin setting up your nginx site config file for using PHP.  This is the sample config file from the initial Configuring nginx HOW-TO on this blog, using foobar.com as the domain name.  Your domain name will be different:</p>

<pre><code>server {
        server_name localhost;
        root /var/www/;

        index index.html index.htm /index.htm;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can tell, this doesn’t include anything about PHP. It only talks about HTML, and the basic server configuration. We will now modify this to include the information necessary to allow the processing of PHP.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to the location of your site’s configuration file.  If you followed the HOW-TO on this site, then the file will be located in /etc/nginx/sites-available/.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the configuration file for your site.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the following to the server block, and then save the file:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>location ~ .php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+.php)(/.+)$;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will add the necessary parameters in order to process the PHP files and serve them correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Restart the nginx service: sudo service nginx restart</p></li>
<li><p>In wherever you stated in the “root” statement in your site’s config, create a file called phpinfo.php, containing the following:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo();
</code></pre>

<p>and then open the page in your Internet browser (in the example config, the site would be <a href="http://foobar.com/phpinfo.php">http://foobar.com/phpinfo.php</a>)</p>

<ol>
<li>If you configured PHP correctly, a page containing various information regarding PHP and your web server should be displayed.  If this is the case, then congratulations, PHP has been successfully configured for your site.  You can now remove the phpinfo.php page (it is not advised to keep that page, as it contains some information which can put your server at risk).  If you did not configure PHP correctly, you will instead be prompted with either a blank page or a download prompt.  If this is the case, make sure you followed the steps in this HOW-TO correctly.</li>
</ol>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2011/12/15/bitcss-project-follow-up/">Bitcss Project Follow-up</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3>First of all</h3>

<p>I wanted to thank you all for showing your interest on this project. Especially to all the twitterers and watchers at github. It is serving me as a motivation to bring this project to life. =D</p>

<h3>And I been giving it some thoughts</h3>

<p>So I been thinking a lot on how to make this really work. I&#8217;m writing this post really to clear my head a little bit.</p>

<p>The problem, making it work is easy. Making it work in an intuitive fashion much like jQuery, is hard. </p>

<h3>Things I thought of</h3>

<p>I have thought about a few ways of going about it but all of them have their pros and cons. I&#8217;d like to hear what you think about them.</p>

<h3>Option #1 - Free-style structure, just a collection of folders.</h3>

<p>This is the simplest method. It&#8217;ll be a soup of all css snippets / examples / themes out there in this one repository. I also find real value in this despite it&#8217;s simplicity.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and started the project in this manner and created the following folders, and we can just keep adding them as the need rises:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>/frameworks - a collection of css frameworks out there</p></li>
<li><p>/themes - a collection of css templates</p></li>
<li><p>/styleguides - a collection of css style guides</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Simple to get going as there is almost no back-end/front-end coding required. It&#8217;ll completely be ran via git and will be a repository with many different collections of css codes / examples / themes that are randomly contributed by members. </p>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>There will be no way to search and cherry pick to mix/match what you want from the template. What you&#8217;ll do is, just browse through many different folders, if you find something you like, you inspect the element, grab the style, and copy / paste to your site. I&#8217;m guessing this is the method most of us are already familiar with.</p>

<h3>Option #2 - Structured CSS naming convention</h3>

<p>This is going to be a bit tougher, as there needs to be a strict guideline to how you style, much like the way <a href="http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming">jquery-ui</a> does it. For every elements out there, such as: modal, header, menu, etc … there will be a standard structured html to style off of.</p>

<p>So a simple example would be a menu:</p>

<ul> <li> …. </li> </ul>


<p>To apply bitcss, you&#8217;d do:</p>

<ul class="bitcss-menu** theme1**">




<li> …. </li>




</ul>


<p>And to use a different theme, you&#8217;d just do:</p>

<ul class="bitcss-menu** theme2**">




<li> …. </li>




</ul>


<p>This all sounds good in theory but this was a super simple example. For things a bit more complex, I have a hard time imagining just how practical it would be. My thoughts on this is that, it requires a strong disciplined community and will rely heavily on utilizing best practices (and I don&#8217;t think anyone really knows what the best practice is). This also means that there will be some form of a design committee that will review and judge, which is something I&#8217;d like to stay away from.</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Once there is some sort of solid guidelines down, I can see it being pretty useful. Anyone can contribute their variations of elements easily just by following the rules and will know exactly how to use/apply to their site.</p>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>It may require a use of SaaS (like google webfonts) to pick and choose exactly the type of style you want to use on your site. I think it can get a bit hairy as there are ton of variations for CSS, compared to fonts:</p>

<p><a href="http://bitcss.com/api/?themes:theme1">http://bitcss.com/api/?themes:theme1</a>[h5,button,menu],theme5[h1,h2,h3,h4,modal]</p>

<h3>Option #3: A database-driven stylesheet guide generator</h3>

<p>This option means no github and it&#8217;ll be on a web platform that lets you visually generate a stylesheet guide from the website.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>User comes to the site</p></li>
<li><p>Clicks on &#8220;Create a stylesheet guide&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>User sees a stylesheet that lists all types of elements from h1 to h5, buttons to modals, etc … etc … much like <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> page</p></li>
<li><p>Only difference is that, with this, you can edit the CSS properties directly by clicking on it</p></li>
<li><p>So if a user wanted a different color scheme for the button.large, user just clicks on that button, change the color css attribute, and hit save</p></li>
<li><p>Think of it like Firebug on a stylesheet guide from the website that saves a css file</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Pros: </strong>No need for manifest.json and setting up git. Those two were what I would of thought can hinder it due to certain level of complexity. It also solves many of the issues of the other options.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The biggest drawback for me is that I&#8217;ll need an entire site to develop. But I think it&#8217;ll make for a cool weekend project.</p>

<h3>So …. my thoughts are ….</h3>

<p>For me, I think #3 is a pretty compelling option and I get the feeling that it&#8217;ll be the most simple to use and provides value right off the gate.</p>

<h1>1 is also something I always wanted, and it seems like it may serve a different purpose so those two can work together. I kind of wanted a folder that had a collection of many different landing page themes, that I can use whenever the need rises, etc …</h1>

<h1>2, I get a little iffy thinking about the structures/guidelines, from my experience, it is almost impossible to follow a guideline.</h1>

<p>So my thoughts are that, I think <strong>#3</strong> is the route to take. But also continue with <strong>#1</strong> to create and support an ever evolving css dump collection.</p>

<h3>Let me hear what you guys think</h3>

<p>Well those were my thoughts, but, I&#8217;d love to hear what you guys think, feel free to leave me a comment or two.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3>A single repository for CSS</h3>

<p>When developing sites, I constantly feel the need to have the ability to quickly browse and choose through hundreds of styles. Like a centralized repository, just for css. Not even just to use them, but even just to serve me as an inspiration.</p>

<p>There are seemingly many single centralized repositories out there, like jquery plugins for js, gems for ruby, and apt for ubuntu, etc. But nothing like it for css.</p>

<h3>Gotta admit that Twitter bootstrap is cool</h3>

<p>Currently, CSS are a pain to re-use but when there is a way (like how twitter bootstrap did), it is simply an enjoyable experience to work off of. But currently they are the only ones that exists of that nature and I don&#8217;t think we will see any more of these anytime soon.</p>

<h3>The Github strategy</h3>

<p>So I&#8217;m creating a centralized github repository, where anyone can crowd-source their CSS and html assets.</p>

<p>Anyone can then easily browse through and choose different types of h1, h2, h3, top menus, boxes, containers, and etc … And everyone is encouraged to to create variations (big or small) to support even more varieties and styles back to the community.</p>

<p>For anyone that is familiar to Remy&#8217;s mit-license repo (<a href="https://github.com/remy/mit-license">github.com/remy/…</a>) it&#8217;ll be like that and it works surprisingly well. There can be some automation done to be better but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that much of an issue.</p>

<h3>Simple to use and simple to contribute</h3>

<p>For those not familiar, it works like this:</p>

<p>1) fork the bitcss repo<br/>
2) add your own folder (like /yourusername/my_bootstrap) with your own copy of the assets (html/images/css) to the repo<br/>

<h3>For the benefit of the web development community</h3>

<p>Considering the small effort it takes to contribute, the amount of benefit the css community as a whole will get is worth it.</p>

<h3>Like an open-source CSS community</h3>

<p>Basically for starters, small contributions of simple stylable elements like modal box, navigations, forms, and alerts/confirm would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Next step is to come up with a front-end interface that lets you browse through these css snippets, and possibly even make it into a SaaS to deliver custom CSS on the fly.</p>

<h3>Need developers!</h3>

<p>I haven&#8217;t really done anything yet up to this point. I&#8217;m just really using this post to validate an idea and see if there is enough people interested in it. Even the github, I need to sitdown and think about the best file structures to support this. If you are interested in being a part of this project or want to just keep tabs on the status of the project, follow me at @jaequery. </p>

		<h3>An Open Source screenshot capture script using PHP and Ubuntu</h3>

<p>For those looking to take screenshots of webpages, I just released a couple scripts to Github that can help you out.</p>

<p>This works on using CutyCapt (qt webkit) and the Xvfb (headless X11).</p>

<p><strong>To get started:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install dependencies</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/jaequery/cutycapt-installer-script-on-ubuntu">[https://github.com/jaequery/cutycapt-installer-script-on-ubuntu](https://github.com/jaequery/cutycapt-installer-script-on-ubuntu)</a></p></li>
<li><p>Get the php script</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/jaequery/php-site-screenshot">[https://github.com/jaequery/php-site-screenshot](https://github.com/jaequery/php-site-screenshot)</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Next, you need to configure the script capture.php:</strong></p>

<p>// lib path<br/>
$xvfb_path = &#8216;/usr/bin&#8217;;<br/>
$cutycapt_path = &#8220;/home/user/scripts/cutycapt/CutyCapt&#8221;;</p>

<p>// capture settings<br/>
$screen = &#8216;1280x1024x24&#8217;;<br/>
$output_path = &#8216;/home/user/www/images/capture.png&#8217;;<br/>
$url = $_GET[&#8216;url&#8217;]; // set it however you want<br/>
//$url = &#8216;http://www.yahoo.com&#8217;; // set it manually</p>

<p><strong>Change them accordingly and you are done</strong></p>

<p>To get you started, here is a simple usage: http://localhost/capture.php?url=http://www.google.com</p>

<p>Hope this is useful to someone.</p>
