		<h3>Design is crucial for your startup</h3>

<p>Being in a startup industry, it didn&#8217;t take me long enough to realize just how critical your web design is to your company. And I don&#8217;t mean to say this in a &#8220;marketing&#8221; gimmick-ish way. I say this from having launched several companies in the past w/ many different types of web designers. The ones that succeeded, always had awesome designs. </p>

<p>A web site can be as clunky as it can be in terms of back-end but if the front-end kicks ass, people can easily overlook the back-end. But the same is not so true in reverse, which is to say, no one gives a crap about the &#8220;back-end&#8221;, as long as it works.</p>

<h3>Good design creates trust</h3>

<p>There is a big difference from launching your product with an &#8220;okay&#8221; design and a &#8220;great&#8221; design. Design will immediately show the visitors how serious your product is. If your idea is great, show the visitor you are for real ($$$) by investing a bit more time and money in the pursuit of an awesome design.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t put a price tag on trust. Trust is the single biggest factor going for any business and relationships. No trust, no business.</p>

<h3>People lust for great designs</h3>

<p>There are some people who says that design is secondary and product comes first. If product sucks, design doesn&#8217;t matter. Yes this is true and if your product sucks, not even a great design will help you there. But if you have a great product and a bad/okay design, you&#8217;ll just be scratching your head why is nobody using our great product? So get a great design, it will initially show you have a great product.</p>

<p>Take a look at mint.com. I&#8217;d be hard willing to bet that if it wasn&#8217;t for their hard design work, they wouldn&#8217;t be anywhere near as where they are now. Their business of saving / money / spreadsheet isn&#8217;t something that attracts people, especially if their design was sub-par. But it was their attractive design that made boring work fun. Not only that, people &#8220;came&#8221; to the site, just to check out how beautiful the site is. That itself is priceless.</p>

<h3>It let&#8217;s you be the &#8220;new kid&#8221; in town</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve launched a new site with an awesome design. You&#8217;ve already changed the landscape of the market and you&#8217;ve created &#8220;awareness&#8221; about your product, just by launching it. Visitor don&#8217;t even have to know your background / history to know that you are going to be a big time player in the space.<br/>
Even if there are competitors that has been in the field for longer than 5-10 years, you&#8217;ve established yourself as the &#8220;new kid&#8221; in town. Doing so has already created a huge psychological advantage over your competitors and will get played out in your favor for chance of success.</p>

<h3>But now, where are all these &#8220;great&#8221; designers?</h3>

<p>The reason why I wanted to write this post is because there seems to be a problem among these &#8220;rock-star&#8221; web designers. They seem to be &#8220;freelance&#8221; only mentality-mode. They don&#8217;t want to be involved in joining a startup it seems, like most web developers do. They seem to view their job as a one-off thing where once they design the work, they must move on to their next project. Mainly because, they often don&#8217;t work for equity, but project based.</p>

<h3>Web designers under-value themselves</h3>

<p>Usually when a startup forms a &#8220;rockstar team&#8221;, it usually involves a high-level CEO and a rockstar &#8220;CTO&#8221;, but really, never a rockstar &#8220;designer&#8221;.</p>

<p>Why? This is the result of a designer under-valuing the importance of what his/her work can bring to the table in a startup. IMO, a rockstar designer should take more stake in a company than a rockstar developer. Apple was one that really knew the importance of design, and it is what shaped their company. Same goes for a other companies, like &#8220;twitter&#8221;, &#8220;basecamp&#8221;, and &#8220;spotify&#8221;. All with strong unique design principles. The design is highly important because it is the first indicator to see if the user wants to user your product. If you miss out on that, it is game overs muchacho. Create a design user likes and he/she will try out your product to see what other cool stuff it is there. So invest your time finding a good designer, it will be your best investment. One way I&#8217;d recommend going about this is to reach out to <a href="http://folyo.me">http://folyo.me</a>, they just launched a service hand-picking all the top designers. </p>

<h3>Web designers need to focus less on projects and more on companies</h3>

<p>Sure, everyone has to make a living and taking jobs project by project is really the only way most of these designers make their earnings. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s fun going from project to project but, there is a point where you realize you just can&#8217;t do this forever. You can say the same for other jobs too but no one dominates the &#8220;freelance&#8221; market as do designers. And by the way, having your &#8220;freelance&#8221; shop, is not really starting your own company. I hope they realize that there is more to be had, than just freelancing.</p>

<h3>Reach out to rockstar designers and get them involved</h3>

<p>We need to start getting these designers involved. They really are some of the hardest working people in the industry and having an amazing designer in your startup DNA will have tremendous benefits over the course of your startup. They usually make great business decisions. Having a design-centric founder will help your startup succeed through envisioning and feeling your product before it&#8217;s even ready. That is a type of skill-set one can&#8217;t just learn but only to be born with.</p>

<h3>Why I believe web designers should start companies? Because, at the end, they are the ones that shape the product.</h3>

<p>I believe they are the best fit to starting companies, especially when it comes to the web. Because they are the ones who can uniquely vision how their product should be and create them. </p>

<p>I know many developers, myself included, can come up with a great idea, but just can not put them on to paper. Even explaining my vision to be relayed to a designer in itself is a monumental task. Without much design sense, my ideas are worthless. </p>

<p>Product life cycle usually goes like this:</p>

<p>1) Idea<br/>
2) Design<br/>
3) Programming</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t recall how many times I had an idea but stopped short because I could not proceed to step 2. For me programming is easy and as once I have the design work ready, I can push it out the door. </p>

<p>But if I were a designer with an idea, I can easily go from idea to design, it doesn&#8217;t even have to be working, but then easily hand it off to other developers to make it function.</p>

<p>Starting from an idea, I (and probably many other developers) started some projects themselves by copying/pasting/printscreen&#8217;ing other people works. But these projects don&#8217;t go very far. The ones that goes successfully from zero to launch, usually have a great set of design laid out for them.</p>

<p>So I believe designers should start companies because they have the most &#8220;abilities&#8221; to get a company off the ground. Once they get their site designed, it&#8217;ll be just a matter of getting the site programmed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3>Think I found something I finally like</h3>

<p>Like I said in my previous post, I think ZF2 is heading in the wrong direction of the &#8220;web language race&#8221;, because the current booming area are in the clean/concise approach of ruby/node/python, but ZF2 is spiraling rapidly into the dogma of Java/.NET.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d normally give the benefit of the doubt and say that with time, it&#8217;ll get better. But I&#8217;m not so sure about. Why? There are just way too much stuff going on, to do something simple. Web app is not rocket science, let&#8217;s not turn it into one.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pretty big shift to go from ZF1 (or any other frameworks out there) to ZF2 that the price of learning it, that I don&#8217;t think is going to be worth it, especially when there are so many options nowadays to creating robust apps easily and quickly. (This ain&#8217;t the PHP4 days anymore)</p>

<p>For those who haven&#8217;t looked into ZF2 yet, here is a quick-start guide: <a href="http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/index.html">[http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/index.html](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/index.html)</a></p>

<p>If you &#8220;got it&#8221; in one glance, I applaud you and I urge you to stop reading this post  and go back to what you were doing a minute earlier. </p>

<h3>The timing of ZF2 and the birth of FuelPHP</h3>

<p>With everything, timing plays a huge role in any new product, and in this case, even framework. </p>

<p>There will soon be hordes of ZF developers looking lost and to see where to go like a bunch of lost refugees in a war-torn country. </p>

<p>All the knowledge and the things they&#8217;ve been accustomed to will have to be discarded and start from square one. </p>

<p>Which isn&#8217;t a bad idea because ZF1 wasn&#8217;t all that great either. However, this is a double-KO to those who have waited and waited for ZF1 to finally be what RoR did for Ruby. There&#8217;s not much you can do but leave.</p>

<p>But leave to where? If you haven&#8217;t heard of FuelPHP, check them out now. IMO, they are the only real PHP framework done right. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that a lot of their core knowledge comes from their previous experiences with CodeIgniter (which I think was probably better than ZF1, even though I haven&#8217;t used it).</p>

<h3>FuelPHP looks pretty awesome</h3>

<p>They got some very clean OOP concept that I think a lot of developers will like. Just comparing zf2&#8217;s docs to their docs, it&#8217;s like going from a physics class to kindergarten. </p>

<p><a href="http://fuelphp.com/docs/index.html">[http://fuelphp.com/docs/index.html](http://fuelphp.com/docs/index.html)</a></p>

<p>Now that&#8217;s a very clean and easy to read documentation. Something I feel I can dive into right away even though I only just began glancing at it.</p>

<p>That too me is what makes good programming. Good programming to me doesn&#8217;t even have design patterns, they are just structured in a way that you are immersed into one, without even realizing you are actually in one. There are too many developers wasting time studying the code instead of developing the code. All most developers need is a good foundation to build off of and once you have that, you should be able to code in your sleep. And I think this new framework does exactly that.</p>

<h3>What about Symfony2?</h3>

<p>Symfony 2 is the other framework that seems to have a strong potential of taking advantage of the timing. But they are kind of in a half-way between ZF and Fuel. Symfony2 to me still has too much baggage (or atleast it feels this way). They also have left a bad taste in people&#8217;s mouth with their previous versions and even previous version of doctrine.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>People will want to try something new this time around and I think FuelPHP seems to fit that bill.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3><strong>A thorn in my daily coding</strong></h3>

<p>I used to be a fan of using dashes in class names but I think that is kind of silly as far as how standardizations go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking we just stick with underscores.</p>

<p>This feels dirty to me:</p>

<p>$(&#8216;#top .drop-menu&#8217;) …</p>

<p>but this doesn&#8217;t:</p>

<p>$(&#8216;#top .drop_menu&#8217;) …</p>

<h3><strong>Now when backend is also involved …</strong></h3>

<p>It gets a lot more awkward when you start to have things like:</p>

<p>$(&#8216;#something input <strong>.first_name</strong> .flashy-background-something&#8217;)</p>

<p>The developers use underscores for their fields relevant to their database, hence the case with .first_name</p>

<p>Also on the server side, they also use underscores for their naming such as $first_name = $this->params(&#8216;first_name&#8217;) …</p>

<h3><strong>Now when IDE is involved …</strong></h3>

<p>Having hyphens can somewhat hinder you when coding. If there is a hyphen in a word, most IDE will just highlight the portion of that. But with underscores, it&#8217;ll highlight the whole word and you can copy/paste/whatever right away.</p>

<h3><strong>It&#8217;s all in the eyes of the beholder</strong></h3>

<p>It&#8217;s all a matter of preference but when you are working with several developers, naming conventions to me goes a long way to a cleaner code.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2011/10/24/zend-framework-2-i-am-disappointed-again/">Zend Framework 2, I Am Disappointed &#8230; Again</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I&#8217;m just going through the changes in Zend Framework 2, I can only shake my head in utter dis-belief and agony.</p>

<p>While other languages such as ruby/python/node are excelling in simplicity, Zend Framework tends to go in the direction more like .NET/Java.</p>

<p>I know that when a person is given enough free time, they are going to &#8220;over-engineer&#8221; things simply because &#8220;you can&#8221;, kind of like breaking a stone and breaking a stone again, in a repeated cycle.</p>

<p>It was not so long ago where I was once caught in this web of Design Patterns thinking they are the holy grail of coding. I had a year of free time to just create/re-create frameworks using multiple patterns all while trying to solve a problem that doesn&#8217;t exist. It was fun and I was proud of my uber framework.</p>

<p>Anyhow, then I got into other languages like ruby/node and more importantly, python. It is at this period where I valued the beauty of &#8220;simplicity&#8221;. Less lines of code == win. Less files == win. Less == win.</p>

<p>With my uber framework, it felt like a juggling act. Everytime I wanted to do something, I had to create hordes of files along with it. Sure, it kept the file clean and short but when you start to have millions of files opened, it starts to get a little exhausting mentally.</p>

<p>In my opinion, PHP was successful because it was &#8220;simple&#8221;. Creating a web app, it really just boils down to a 3 part process. Get the request, process the request, output the request. Only thing I&#8217;d like from a framework are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data layer</li>
<li>Auth / ACL</li>
<li>Controllers</li>
<li>A nice little library of helper methods</li>
</ul>


<p>Having said this, I don&#8217;t like the direction of where current PHP ORM&#8217;s are going. They are meant to let you perform data commands without SQL at the expense of performance and somewhat initial learning curve. There is no win here. If you want high performance, ORM is not it. You go through SQL/Stored Procedures. Just a simple query builder should be enough for ORM, just query and get the data.</p>

<p>There is not much else to it. Most apps can be created fairly quickly, securely, and robustly. Without all the baggage that comes from frameworks/cms. I was only able to grasp this concept after several years, and can now reason with Rasmus Lerdorf said a few years back. Coding should be simple. Most coding can be done very simply and that OOP for PHP is quite flawed. It&#8217;s like trying to get an elephant to ride a bike. </p>

<p>Just look at javascript, now that is an OOP language. Not only that, it is event-driven and lets you do far more complex things that PHP can&#8217;t do. </p>

<p>I wish Zend developers would try to consider beautifying the language. I said this even before Zend Framework had a public 1.0 release that there are several flawed logics in it and will be a complete spagetti soup. The moment VR came out, it seems no one but me understood it is breaking the sheer logic of what the View <em>should</em> do. The separation of layout and view also was weird to me, as they should be one and the same. It is only now developers seem to be realizing this. </p>

<p>So enough is enough. Enough…</p>

<p>It is time PHP world understands what beautifying the code can do to providing a robust/secure/fast code.</p>

<h3>And so</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m starting a new kind of framework. It&#8217;s called Jien Framework. Jien named after my daughter, Jiena.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I just have to say, Zend View Renderer is like the magic of all magic methods. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s such a PITA to understand what the heck it does.</p>

<p>I just want to simply override the view script to another view script. I know there is one for switching view script folder path, but what about the script file?</p>

<p>ViewRenderer == FAIL</p>

<p>And no, render() doesn&#8217;t do jack for me even though it attempts to look for it. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s just too magical.</p>

<p><strong><em>update</em></strong></p>

<p>So I had to use $this->_helper->viewRenderer(&#8216;form&#8217;); instead of $tihs->view->render(&#8216;form&#8217;);</p>

<p>I hate tricky naming conventions like this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h3>New job, new everything</h3>

<p>So with my new job, they had an environment like I&#8217;ve never seen before.<br/>
Mainly, a strict policy of, &#8220;No jQuery!&#8221; </p>

<p>My initial reaction was, O_o</p>

<p>But something inside me wanted to venture out and try some new stuff.</p>

<h3>Mootools</h3>

<p>So I&#8217;ve dived myself into mootools. It only took me like 1 hour to realize that it&#8217;s not really a framework at all. It&#8217;s almost like a set of helper methods, something I already have with my core js lib. There are some key noticeable difference in the way you select elements (where jQuery is king). </p>

<p>In jQuery, $(….your css selectors…) can be used … even abused.</p>

<p>But in mootools, there is a distinction of retrieving a single element and multiple element.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>In jquery, I can do this $(&#8216;#tab&#8217;).hide(); ,  which will go out and hide #tab<br/>
In mootools, I can do that also with $(&#8216;tab&#8217;).hide();</p>

<p>In jquery, I can also do $(&#8216;.tab&#8217;).hide();  which will remove all elements with a tab class.</p>

<p>But in mootools … a big but …</p>

<p>I have to do $$(&#8216;.tab&#8217;).hide():</p>

<p>It may seem as it&#8217;s something you can just learn to live with but man this sucks a lot. It is annoying to think this way and it hinders rapid development.</p>

<p>There are things that&#8217;s seriously lacking in mootools. Such as append(), prepend().<br/>
So for me to append something to body, I&#8217;d have to get the dom and replace the whole dom with some stuff added to it.</p>

<p>Event delegation in mootools is also quite different too, but I got used to it, so no biggie.</p>

<p>But aside from that, mootools is alright. It&#8217;s just not as powerful in terms of DOM. Mootool&#8217;s helper classes are okay too, I tend to have a better collection of helpers anyway so never needed to use theirs.</p>

<h3></h3>

<p>Angularjs &amp; Backbonejs</p>

<p>It seems backbone/knockout are all the rage these days. I never bought into the hype until I was forced to work with it at my current job. And I tell you, boy, this was a beast to work with. This put a paradigm shift in terms of what I already know about web development. It took me back to the days of when I was learning Visual Basic. It is how it feels and runs. Something I always wanted the web to be but over time, I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to the stateless environment.</p>

<p>So having said that, what Angularjs does is, it binds data object directly to your DOM. It takes a bit to understand it, but once you do, it&#8217;s actually pretty cool.</p>

<p>Think of your website as a giant javascript object, where you just change the property of it, and it updates it on your website instantly.</p>

<p>So traditionally, one would do: </p>

<div id='#populateme'></div>


<p></p>

<script>  
$('#populateme').html('i am populating you');  
</script>


<p> </p>

<p>But in angular:</p>

<div ng:bind="populateme"></div>


<p> </p>

<script>  
this.populateme = 'i am populating you';  
</script>


<p> </p>

<p>You can even do methods: </p>

<div ng:bind="populateme()"></div>


<p> </p>

<script>  
this.populateme = function(){  
    return 'i am populating you from a method';  
}  
</script>


<p>  </p>

<p>It takes some time to get used to but I think this does somewhat help you organize your code better. I never got to a point where my code was un-readable for me to need this. Imo, it is a cool concept but it does force you / limit you to code in a specific pattern. If you are using jquery events, you&#8217;ll have to use event delegation on almost everything since the DOM is generated after the site has loaded.</p>

<h3></h3>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>There are lot of things I like and don&#8217;t like but my conclusion is that: </p>

<p>1) mootools is alright, there&#8217;s just nothing there to get me excited about<br/>
2) knockout/angular is cool but not really my cup of tea (yet). also it&#8217;d be problematic with SEO, so it&#8217;s mainly for admin purposes.</p>

		<h3>There will be some changes</h3>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy balancing my full-time job with my side projects but finally with some help, we will start releasing themes that are fully-compatible with Tumblr.</p>

<p>Why Tumblr? Because surprisingly, more than half our user base is Tumblr users!<br/>
Tumblr roughly has outgrown Wordpress and Blogger users combined! It&#8217;s a stat that we aren&#8217;t taking it lightly and we feel there is a strong potential to be had with Tumblr.</p>

<p>Bye for now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>The birth of Jien Framework</h2>

<p>Hi all, I&#8217;m working on a brand new PHP5 framework/CMS called Jien Framework.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p>Because there is none that lets me go straight to coding and crank away on the project. There is a steep learning curve to current frameworks/CMS&#8217;es.</p>

<h4>What about like Drupal and Joomla?</h4>

<p>They are the epitome of why development sucks. None of them are &#8220;lean&#8221; or shall I say &#8220;barebone&#8221; for me to take it and go crazy with it. If I&#8217;m working on a brand new spanking app, they are not what I will build on top of.</p>

<h4>So you say, how about like Zend Framework, Code Ignitor, and Yii?</h4>

<p>I personally prefer these over a CMS any day. They are light enough for me to build out an app and customize the hell out of it. But that&#8217;s where the good ends. Where&#8217;s the admin? The basic CMS?</p>

<h4>Jien is built on top of Zend Framework</h4>

<p>And thus, I am creating a CMS that is built on top of Zend Framework for rapid development. I am also adding a lot of the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained into this so you&#8217;ll have all the benefits of user management, multi-backend scaling, and many more.</p>

<h4>How long has it been in development?</h4>

<p>Few days</p>

<h4>Who can contribute?</h4>

<p>Anybody!</p>

<h4>How and where can I check out the code?</h4>

<p><a href="http://github.com/jaequery/jien">http://github.com/jaequery/jien</a></p>

<h4>Where can I see the live demo?</h4>

<p><a href="http://jien.jaequery.com/admin">http://jien.jaequery.com/admin</a></p>

<p>user: admin pass: demo</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the first time I checked out Thesis in-depth and I must say, Thesis really fails to live up to my expectations, due to how they&#8217;ve marketed their product. I think theming a thesis site is really difficult, especially if the design is custom-made. My overview of Thesis is that, it suits beginners who really only need slight modifications to their blogs and don&#8217;t know much about CSS. Big thumbs up to owners of Thesis for marketing their product, it&#8217;s pretty crazy how people bought into their product.</p>

<p>I think a blog shouldn&#8217;t be overwhelming and should feel like a giant scrapyard of your thoughts. Wordpress to me feels a bit too &#8220;marketing-ish&#8221; and Posterous just doesn&#8217;t really yet have that &#8220;blog&#8221; feel to me, it just feels like sticky-notes.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, I&#8217;d create my own blog platform but I just don&#8217;t have time to do that. That&#8217;s probably the case with all developers. Why re-invent the wheel right?</p>
