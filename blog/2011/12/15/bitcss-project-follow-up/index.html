	<h1 class="title">Bitcss Project Follow-up</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><h3>First of all</h3>

<p>I wanted to thank you all for showing your interest on this project. Especially to all the twitterers and watchers at github. It is serving me as a motivation to bring this project to life. =D</p>

<h3>And I been giving it some thoughts</h3>

<p>So I been thinking a lot on how to make this really work. I&#8217;m writing this post really to clear my head a little bit.</p>

<p>The problem, making it work is easy. Making it work in an intuitive fashion much like jQuery, is hard. </p>

<h3>Things I thought of</h3>

<p>I have thought about a few ways of going about it but all of them have their pros and cons. I&#8217;d like to hear what you think about them.</p>

<h3>Option #1 - Free-style structure, just a collection of folders.</h3>

<p>This is the simplest method. It&#8217;ll be a soup of all css snippets / examples / themes out there in this one repository. I also find real value in this despite it&#8217;s simplicity.</p>

<p>So I went ahead and started the project in this manner and created the following folders, and we can just keep adding them as the need rises:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>/frameworks - a collection of css frameworks out there</p></li>
<li><p>/themes - a collection of css templates</p></li>
<li><p>/styleguides - a collection of css style guides</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Simple to get going as there is almost no back-end/front-end coding required. It&#8217;ll completely be ran via git and will be a repository with many different collections of css codes / examples / themes that are randomly contributed by members. </p>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>There will be no way to search and cherry pick to mix/match what you want from the template. What you&#8217;ll do is, just browse through many different folders, if you find something you like, you inspect the element, grab the style, and copy / paste to your site. I&#8217;m guessing this is the method most of us are already familiar with.</p>

<h3>Option #2 - Structured CSS naming convention</h3>

<p>This is going to be a bit tougher, as there needs to be a strict guideline to how you style, much like the way <a href="http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming">jquery-ui</a> does it. For every elements out there, such as: modal, header, menu, etc … there will be a standard structured html to style off of.</p>

<p>So a simple example would be a menu:</p>

<ul> <li> …. </li> </ul>


<p>To apply bitcss, you&#8217;d do:</p>

<ul class="bitcss-menu** theme1**">




<li> …. </li>




</ul>


<p>And to use a different theme, you&#8217;d just do:</p>

<ul class="bitcss-menu** theme2**">




<li> …. </li>




</ul>


<p>This all sounds good in theory but this was a super simple example. For things a bit more complex, I have a hard time imagining just how practical it would be. My thoughts on this is that, it requires a strong disciplined community and will rely heavily on utilizing best practices (and I don&#8217;t think anyone really knows what the best practice is). This also means that there will be some form of a design committee that will review and judge, which is something I&#8217;d like to stay away from.</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Once there is some sort of solid guidelines down, I can see it being pretty useful. Anyone can contribute their variations of elements easily just by following the rules and will know exactly how to use/apply to their site.</p>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong>It may require a use of SaaS (like google webfonts) to pick and choose exactly the type of style you want to use on your site. I think it can get a bit hairy as there are ton of variations for CSS, compared to fonts:</p>

<p><a href="http://bitcss.com/api/?themes:theme1">http://bitcss.com/api/?themes:theme1</a>[h5,button,menu],theme5[h1,h2,h3,h4,modal]</p>

<h3>Option #3: A database-driven stylesheet guide generator</h3>

<p>This option means no github and it&#8217;ll be on a web platform that lets you visually generate a stylesheet guide from the website.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>User comes to the site</p></li>
<li><p>Clicks on &#8220;Create a stylesheet guide&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>User sees a stylesheet that lists all types of elements from h1 to h5, buttons to modals, etc … etc … much like <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> page</p></li>
<li><p>Only difference is that, with this, you can edit the CSS properties directly by clicking on it</p></li>
<li><p>So if a user wanted a different color scheme for the button.large, user just clicks on that button, change the color css attribute, and hit save</p></li>
<li><p>Think of it like Firebug on a stylesheet guide from the website that saves a css file</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Pros: </strong>No need for manifest.json and setting up git. Those two were what I would of thought can hinder it due to certain level of complexity. It also solves many of the issues of the other options.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The biggest drawback for me is that I&#8217;ll need an entire site to develop. But I think it&#8217;ll make for a cool weekend project.</p>

<h3>So …. my thoughts are ….</h3>

<p>For me, I think #3 is a pretty compelling option and I get the feeling that it&#8217;ll be the most simple to use and provides value right off the gate.</p>

<h1>1 is also something I always wanted, and it seems like it may serve a different purpose so those two can work together. I kind of wanted a folder that had a collection of many different landing page themes, that I can use whenever the need rises, etc …</h1>

<h1>2, I get a little iffy thinking about the structures/guidelines, from my experience, it is almost impossible to follow a guideline.</h1>

<p>So my thoughts are that, I think <strong>#3</strong> is the route to take. But also continue with <strong>#1</strong> to create and support an ever evolving css dump collection.</p>

<h3>Let me hear what you guys think</h3>

<p>Well those were my thoughts, but, I&#8217;d love to hear what you guys think, feel free to leave me a comment or two.</p>
