	<div class="entry-content"><h3>Design is crucial for your startup</h3>

<p>Being in a startup industry, it didn&#8217;t take me long enough to realize just how critical your web design is to your company. And I don&#8217;t mean to say this in a &#8220;marketing&#8221; gimmick-ish way. I say this from having launched several companies in the past w/ many different types of web designers. The ones that succeeded, always had awesome designs. </p>

<p>A web site can be as clunky as it can be in terms of back-end but if the front-end kicks ass, people can easily overlook the back-end. But the same is not so true in reverse, which is to say, no one gives a crap about the &#8220;back-end&#8221;, as long as it works.</p>

<h3>Good design creates trust</h3>

<p>There is a big difference from launching your product with an &#8220;okay&#8221; design and a &#8220;great&#8221; design. Design will immediately show the visitors how serious your product is. If your idea is great, show the visitor you are for real ($$$) by investing a bit more time and money in the pursuit of an awesome design.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t put a price tag on trust. Trust is the single biggest factor going for any business and relationships. No trust, no business.</p>

<h3>People lust for great designs</h3>

<p>There are some people who says that design is secondary and product comes first. If product sucks, design doesn&#8217;t matter. Yes this is true and if your product sucks, not even a great design will help you there. But if you have a great product and a bad/okay design, you&#8217;ll just be scratching your head why is nobody using our great product? So get a great design, it will initially show you have a great product.</p>

<p>Take a look at mint.com. I&#8217;d be hard willing to bet that if it wasn&#8217;t for their hard design work, they wouldn&#8217;t be anywhere near as where they are now. Their business of saving / money / spreadsheet isn&#8217;t something that attracts people, especially if their design was sub-par. But it was their attractive design that made boring work fun. Not only that, people &#8220;came&#8221; to the site, just to check out how beautiful the site is. That itself is priceless.</p>

<h3>It let&#8217;s you be the &#8220;new kid&#8221; in town</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve launched a new site with an awesome design. You&#8217;ve already changed the landscape of the market and you&#8217;ve created &#8220;awareness&#8221; about your product, just by launching it. Visitor don&#8217;t even have to know your background / history to know that you are going to be a big time player in the space.<br/>
Even if there are competitors that has been in the field for longer than 5-10 years, you&#8217;ve established yourself as the &#8220;new kid&#8221; in town. Doing so has already created a huge psychological advantage over your competitors and will get played out in your favor for chance of success.</p>

<h3>But now, where are all these &#8220;great&#8221; designers?</h3>

<p>The reason why I wanted to write this post is because there seems to be a problem among these &#8220;rock-star&#8221; web designers. They seem to be &#8220;freelance&#8221; only mentality-mode. They don&#8217;t want to be involved in joining a startup it seems, like most web developers do. They seem to view their job as a one-off thing where once they design the work, they must move on to their next project. Mainly because, they often don&#8217;t work for equity, but project based.</p>

<h3>Web designers under-value themselves</h3>

<p>Usually when a startup forms a &#8220;rockstar team&#8221;, it usually involves a high-level CEO and a rockstar &#8220;CTO&#8221;, but really, never a rockstar &#8220;designer&#8221;.</p>

<p>Why? This is the result of a designer under-valuing the importance of what his/her work can bring to the table in a startup. IMO, a rockstar designer should take more stake in a company than a rockstar developer. Apple was one that really knew the importance of design, and it is what shaped their company. Same goes for a other companies, like &#8220;twitter&#8221;, &#8220;basecamp&#8221;, and &#8220;spotify&#8221;. All with strong unique design principles. The design is highly important because it is the first indicator to see if the user wants to user your product. If you miss out on that, it is game overs muchacho. Create a design user likes and he/she will try out your product to see what other cool stuff it is there. So invest your time finding a good designer, it will be your best investment. One way I&#8217;d recommend going about this is to reach out to <a href="http://folyo.me">http://folyo.me</a>, they just launched a service hand-picking all the top designers. </p>

<h3>Web designers need to focus less on projects and more on companies</h3>

<p>Sure, everyone has to make a living and taking jobs project by project is really the only way most of these designers make their earnings. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s fun going from project to project but, there is a point where you realize you just can&#8217;t do this forever. You can say the same for other jobs too but no one dominates the &#8220;freelance&#8221; market as do designers. And by the way, having your &#8220;freelance&#8221; shop, is not really starting your own company. I hope they realize that there is more to be had, than just freelancing.</p>

<h3>Reach out to rockstar designers and get them involved</h3>

<p>We need to start getting these designers involved. They really are some of the hardest working people in the industry and having an amazing designer in your startup DNA will have tremendous benefits over the course of your startup. They usually make great business decisions. Having a design-centric founder will help your startup succeed through envisioning and feeling your product before it&#8217;s even ready. That is a type of skill-set one can&#8217;t just learn but only to be born with.</p>

<h3>Why I believe web designers should start companies? Because, at the end, they are the ones that shape the product.</h3>

<p>I believe they are the best fit to starting companies, especially when it comes to the web. Because they are the ones who can uniquely vision how their product should be and create them. </p>

<p>I know many developers, myself included, can come up with a great idea, but just can not put them on to paper. Even explaining my vision to be relayed to a designer in itself is a monumental task. Without much design sense, my ideas are worthless. </p>

<p>Product life cycle usually goes like this:</p>

<p>1) Idea<br/>
2) Design<br/>
3) Programming</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t recall how many times I had an idea but stopped short because I could not proceed to step 2. For me programming is easy and as once I have the design work ready, I can push it out the door. </p>

<p>But if I were a designer with an idea, I can easily go from idea to design, it doesn&#8217;t even have to be working, but then easily hand it off to other developers to make it function.</p>

<p>Starting from an idea, I (and probably many other developers) started some projects themselves by copying/pasting/printscreen&#8217;ing other people works. But these projects don&#8217;t go very far. The ones that goes successfully from zero to launch, usually have a great set of design laid out for them.</p>

<p>So I believe designers should start companies because they have the most &#8220;abilities&#8221; to get a company off the ground. Once they get their site designed, it&#8217;ll be just a matter of getting the site programmed.</p>
