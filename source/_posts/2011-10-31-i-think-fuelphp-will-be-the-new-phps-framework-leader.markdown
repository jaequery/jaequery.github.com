### Think I found something I finally like




Like I said in my previous post, I think ZF2 is heading in the wrong direction of the "web language race", because the current booming area are in the clean/concise approach of ruby/node/python, but ZF2 is spiraling rapidly into the dogma of Java/.NET.




I'd normally give the benefit of the doubt and say that with time, it'll get better. But I'm not so sure about. Why? There are just way too much stuff going on, to do something simple. Web app is not rocket science, let's not turn it into one.




It's a pretty big shift to go from ZF1 (or any other frameworks out there) to ZF2 that the price of learning it, that I don't think is going to be worth it, especially when there are so many options nowadays to creating robust apps easily and quickly. (This ain't the PHP4 days anymore)




For those who haven't looked into ZF2 yet, here is a quick-start guide: [[http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/index.html](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/index.html)](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/index.html)




If you "got it" in one glance, I applaud you and I urge you to stop reading this post  and go back to what you were doing a minute earlier. 




### The timing of ZF2 and the birth of FuelPHP




With everything, timing plays a huge role in any new product, and in this case, even framework. 




There will soon be hordes of ZF developers looking lost and to see where to go like a bunch of lost refugees in a war-torn country. 




All the knowledge and the things they've been accustomed to will have to be discarded and start from square one. 




Which isn't a bad idea because ZF1 wasn't all that great either. However, this is a double-KO to those who have waited and waited for ZF1 to finally be what RoR did for Ruby. There's not much you can do but leave.




But leave to where? If you haven't heard of FuelPHP, check them out now. IMO, they are the only real PHP framework done right. It doesn't hurt that a lot of their core knowledge comes from their previous experiences with CodeIgniter (which I think was probably better than ZF1, even though I haven't used it).




### FuelPHP looks pretty awesome




They got some very clean OOP concept that I think a lot of developers will like. Just comparing zf2's docs to their docs, it's like going from a physics class to kindergarten. 




[[http://fuelphp.com/docs/index.html](http://fuelphp.com/docs/index.html)](http://fuelphp.com/docs/index.html)




Now that's a very clean and easy to read documentation. Something I feel I can dive into right away even though I only just began glancing at it.




That too me is what makes good programming. Good programming to me doesn't even have design patterns, they are just structured in a way that you are immersed into one, without even realizing you are actually in one. There are too many developers wasting time studying the code instead of developing the code. All most developers need is a good foundation to build off of and once you have that, you should be able to code in your sleep. And I think this new framework does exactly that.




### What about Symfony2?




Symfony 2 is the other framework that seems to have a strong potential of taking advantage of the timing. But they are kind of in a half-way between ZF and Fuel. Symfony2 to me still has too much baggage (or atleast it feels this way). They also have left a bad taste in people's mouth with their previous versions and even previous version of doctrine.




### Conclusion




People will want to try something new this time around and I think FuelPHP seems to fit that bill.
