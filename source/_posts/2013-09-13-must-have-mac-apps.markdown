Here are some mac apps I think are worthy of sharing:

1. [Hyperswitch](http://bahoom.com/hyperswitch) - Free
I've used Witch (paid) thus far but I always got annoyed with the fact that it has really bad tracking of last used app. So if I have 10 windows open and then I jump from Mail to Chrome, and then I hit cmd-tab back, it would not switch me back to Mail. I've lived with this limitation and today I decided I am fed up with it, so did a bit of googling and found a new App Switcher called Hyperswitch. I was reluctant at first, due to price being free, and I was so accustomed to Witch, but I figured it was worth a shot. After installing and running, little to my amazement, this is much better than Witch. It could use some work in that, if you have 3+ Chrome windows open, it still grouped as one, but I've come to live with it. This is definitely a big new app that I'll be using for long time.

Hyperswitch vs Witch = Hyperswitch wins, less clunky and saves your last used app so it's great for hitting cmd-tab repetitively.

2. [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) - Free (or $13)
To resize, move, maximize windows, I been using an app called Moon. It suited my needs but when it resizes or move window, it performs an animation that'd be slow. Also it is two key combination, one to activate, and another to move/resize/maximize. Luckily, I found another little gem, which more than fits my needs. Now to resize/maximize/move, I just now hit ctrl-option-up, ctrl-option-down, ctrl-option-left/right.

These guys also have another app called "Cinch", which is also pretty cool in that, you can maximize window just by dragging the window to the top most section of the monitor, and restore it back by dragging it down. It'd been awesome if you dragged it down, it resizes to smaller window centered on the screen. Oh well.

Moon vs SizeUp = SizeUp wins, it's easier and faster.
