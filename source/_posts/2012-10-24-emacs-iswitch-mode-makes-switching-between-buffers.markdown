i somehow came across this [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/IswitchBuffers](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/IswitchBuffers)](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/IswitchBuffers) and i'm thinking to myself how i didn't know about it this whole time.




basically on your ~/.emacs, just put this line of code:  
(iswitchb-mode 1)





and now create multiple buffers, either through multi-window (ctrl+x+2) or (ctrl+f … and type file name)




now just hit ctrl+b, it's like mac finder, awesome.
