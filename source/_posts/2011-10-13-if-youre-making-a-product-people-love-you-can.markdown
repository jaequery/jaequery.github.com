The best quote from [Mark Zuckerberg’s talk at Web 2.0 Summit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czw-dtTP6oU&feature=player_embedded).  If you combine this with his second best quote regarding FB’s current core principles of “move fast, move bold” you have the makings of why Facebook is what it is today: _purposefully_ fumbling toward greatness.
