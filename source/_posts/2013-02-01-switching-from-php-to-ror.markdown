In one unlikely evening, I was bored and just felt like doing something new, I did something I probably never thought I'd do. Jump into RoR.
I say unlikely because those that knows me, knows how much of a PHP advocate I am. Afterall, I didn't spend 10+ years on it for nothing.
I'm also not the type to stop on something until I've mastered it. I suddenly now have quite a challenge on my hands.
