Right now, I'm at James house and I'm trying to help him out finish up a wordpress theme for his freelance gig. He is having some issues with the Thesis framework.




It's the first time I checked out Thesis in-depth and I must say, Thesis really fails to live up to my expectations, due to how they've marketed their product. I think theming a thesis site is really difficult, especially if the design is custom-made. My overview of Thesis is that, it suits beginners who really only need slight modifications to their blogs and don't know much about CSS. Big thumbs up to owners of Thesis for marketing their product, it's pretty crazy how people bought into their product.
