### There will be some changes




It wasn't easy balancing my full-time job with my side projects but finally with some help, we will start releasing themes that are fully-compatible with Tumblr.




Why Tumblr? Because surprisingly, more than half our user base is Tumblr users!  
Tumblr roughly has outgrown Wordpress and Blogger users combined! It's a stat that we aren't taking it lightly and we feel there is a strong potential to be had with Tumblr.




Bye for now.
