I decided to go with Tumblr over all the other blogging platforms like Wordpress, Posterous, etc â€¦ because Tumblr really understands blogging.




I think a blog shouldn't be overwhelming and should feel like a giant scrapyard of your thoughts. Wordpress to me feels a bit too "marketing-ish" and Posterous just doesn't really yet have that "blog" feel to me, it just feels like sticky-notes.




Quite frankly, I'd create my own blog platform but I just don't have time to do that. That's probably the case with all developers. Why re-invent the wheel right?
