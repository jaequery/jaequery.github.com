## The birth of Jien Framework




Hi all, I'm working on a brand new PHP5 framework/CMS called Jien Framework.




#### Why?




Because there is none that lets me go straight to coding and crank away on the project. There is a steep learning curve to current frameworks/CMS'es.




#### What about like Drupal and Joomla?




They are the epitome of why development sucks. None of them are "lean" or shall I say "barebone" for me to take it and go crazy with it. If I'm working on a brand new spanking app, they are not what I will build on top of.




#### So you say, how about like Zend Framework, Code Ignitor, and Yii?




I personally prefer these over a CMS any day. They are light enough for me to build out an app and customize the hell out of it. But that's where the good ends. Where's the admin? The basic CMS?




#### Jien is built on top of Zend Framework




And thus, I am creating a CMS that is built on top of Zend Framework for rapid development. I am also adding a lot of the knowledge I've gained into this so you'll have all the benefits of user management, multi-backend scaling, and many more.




#### How long has it been in development?




Few days




#### Who can contribute?




Anybody!




#### How and where can I check out the code?
