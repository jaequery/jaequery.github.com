*How do I buy a bitcoin* is perhaps one of the most common questions I get. So here is a quick guide of how *I* did it.

I thought buying a  was difficult at first but with a bit of research, it turned out pretty simple.

Here are several different approaches that I took to buy bitcoins.

Option 1: Coinbase (Can do it all online, just provide your bank info)
I registered at coinbase.com because they looked so legit. I gave them  info and within an hour, I was  to buy a bitcoin. They did have a $1k bitcoin transaction limit and I wanted to put in more so I had to look for an alternative. Depositing the money was painless and buying was also painless. However, from the moment I purchased, it took me 5 full days for my bitcoin to get into my account. Which is an incredibly long time in a bitcoin world.

Option 2: Bitfloor (Need to hit the bank or Moneygrams, but I prefer this)
After much research, I chose bitfloor.com. I signed up and they told me all I needed to do now was perform a  deposit (LocalTill) or send a wire transfer to the info they provided. This process seemed daunting at first but it was as easy as depositing my own money. I used the LocalTill option which charges about 3% of the transaction fee and within minutes, I got a notification that my money have been added and ready to use. Then I went to their Trade, and put in how much I wanted to buy and within minutes, I had my bitcoins!

Option 3: Dwolla +  (I haven't tried it yet, I'm still in the waiting queue, I'll update this post once I try it out)
