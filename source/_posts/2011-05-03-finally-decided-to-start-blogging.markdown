Yes I have finally decided to start my own blog empire here on tumblr.




I've fiddled with the thought of running it on Wordpress but then again, 99% of bloggers are on Wordpress. I want to be more different than them.




Currently, I've started re-vamping Stiqr.com. Don't really have a lot of time to work on it but I'm chipping it away little by little.
