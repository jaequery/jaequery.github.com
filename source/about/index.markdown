I am an entrepreneurial coder with an obsesion for performance and simplicity. I have over 13+ years experience in web development with my main expertise in js/php/sql. Currently a CTO at processing.com, where we are looking to do great things in the international card processing industry.

I've been known by my peers to be great at starting companies and making things quickly. I love startups.

You can usually find me on freenode at #startups
