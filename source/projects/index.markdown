## Some of my pet projects

* stiqr.com
: Stiqr is a javascript widget that you embed on your site which allows users to dress up (or design) their site with simple point and click, similar to how users design in photoshop. Currently in use by over 100k+ users from Tumblr, Blogspot, and Wordpress.

* gethoneybadger.com
: gethoneybadger is a chrome extension that I developed to quickly check the background info of the site I'm on. The data is pulled in by various places, such as Crunchbase, Wiki, Compete, to provide you with the company's traffic, their history, funding status, as well as the people behind the site. Currently in use by over 10,000 users and serves over 2MM+ requests per day.

* jien.jaequery.com 
: Jien Framework is a PHP5 framework that I created for rapid prototyping and deployment. It is built on top of Zend Framework and it's purpose is to do things in a minimal and flexible way, such as interacting with database and templates. It comes with an Admin powered by Bootstrap Template as well as scaffolding options.
