    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Day 2 of Ruby</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s strange and I and confused by all these weird syntaxes.</p>

<p>Coming from PHP, I assumed at first glance:</p>

<pre><code>   @name (ruby) is $name (php)
</code></pre>

<p>But no, because in ruby, you have several different ways of assigning a variable.</p>

<p>There are:</p>

<ul>
<li>@name (instance var)</li>
<li>@@name (class var)</li>
<li>name (method var)</li>
</ul>


<p>Not to mention, &#8220;symbols&#8221; which really threw me off guard.</p>

<p>Anyhow, here is what I found out.</p>

<h3>@name (instance var)</h3>

<p>Instance vars are similar to $this->name in php.
So @name = $this->name.</p>

<h3>@@name (class var)</h3>

<p>Now this one is a bit tricky. Class vars probably won&#8217;t ring a bell to PHP developer as in PHP, class vars are like instance vars. However in Ruby, @@name is similar to static vars.</p>

<p>The reason why it&#8217;s that is because if you have 3-4+ instances of a class, @@name is shared by all of them. Somewhat of a singleton variable.</p>

<h3>name (method var)</h3>

<p>This is pretty straight forward. It&#8217;s a var that only lives inside a method. Good for throwaway/temporary variables, such as res, total, etc &#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In one unlikely evening, I was bored and just felt like doing something new, I did something I probably never thought I&#8217;d do. Jump into RoR.
I say unlikely because those that knows me, knows how much of a PHP advocate I am. Afterall, I didn&#8217;t spend 10+ years on it for nothing.</p>

<p>I must give credit due to the fact that I did switch to mac recently. Funny how a mac can change the views of the world, like how a true hipster would say.</p>

<p>Anyhow this is just a test for octopress. My main blog is still at http://www.jaequery.com, who knows, perhaps I&#8217;ll move it all over to this one.</p>
